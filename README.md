##Statistical Analysis
Having data analyzed is very important, and being able to quickly get a summary of the data at hand in addition to a visual representation is quite useful. This program will determine the median, mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of up to 2 data sets. Then, it will display a line graph and a scatterplot, respectively.

##Functionality
The user can enter data into data set 1 or data 2, or both. The user must seperate the numbers by spaces. If the user puts a comma, enters a string, or special characters, the data set field will read "Invalid Input". They can only edit the data set 1 and data set 2 fields. If one is satisfied with their input, click the convert button. Now, a line graph and a scatter plot will show up. If the user wishes to put in a different data set, they must push the "reset" button. This will clear both of the data sets as well as the Graph.

##Note
This program utilizes JavaFx version 17.0.9. The user must have Java and an application that can run it. The user must add the referenced libraries. The user must create a launch.json file. Within the launch.json file, the user must add "vmArgs:" with the module path and modules to add.
